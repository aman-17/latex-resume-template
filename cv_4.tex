\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Image Processing Intern, Appyhub Technology Solutions}{October 2020 - Present}{}{}
\item A part of the core engineering team and focus on the development of robust, scalable, extensible software applications used by millions of users. Worked on high-end research and varied technologies based on the allocated work streams like Computer Vision \& Deep Learning.
% \item Responsible for programming, documenting and maintaining web applications in a fast-paced project environment.

\end{rSubsection}


%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Director, Open Source Community: VIT-AP}{July 2019 - May 2020}{}{}
\item Responsible for bringing sponsors, planning and organizing various events. Also helped students to grow their technical skills.

\end{rSubsection}

\end{rSection}



\begin{rSection}{Research}

\begin{rSubsection}{Efficientword-Net: An Open Source Hotword Detection Engine Based On One Shot Learning.}{}{}
\item This was developed since existing hotword detection architectures often are binary classifiers requiring huge amounts of dataset and retraining for every new hotword, our research project solved it by requiring only 4 to 5 samples of a hotword. We achieved 94.51\% accuracy on the resulting model.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Precise URL Phishing Detection Using Sequential Neural Networks.}{}{}
\item The research was about prediction of URLs whether they are malicious using Genetic Algorithms. Achieved maximum of 97.1\% accuracy using GRU architecture.
\end{rSubsection}


\end{rSection}


\begin{rSection}{Recent Projects}

\begin{rSubsection}{Lela- Smart Dietician \& Yoga Posture Detector.}{}{}
\item Lela is a web based application that provides the user with a diet plan. Also, it helps us to make our posture right while performing yoga. Yoga posture detection is based on PoseNet.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{DDoSDet: An Approach To Detect DDoS Attacks Using Neural Networks.}{}{}
\item In this research project, I presented the detection of DDoS attacks using neural networks, that would flag malicious and legitimate data flow, preventing network performance degradation with 99\% accuracy.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN.}{}{}
\item I built a real-time facial emotion recognition system using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The dataset used was FER2013 and architecture was written in Keras and Tensorflow. The emotions were displayed on the terminal with a probability between 0 and 1.
